          <h2>Short Bio</h2>
          <p>I am Koen Vandezande, I was born in Leuven in 1968. It is also the city where I grew up and got my degree in Information Technology. After my mandatory military service I worked for 19 years in a hospital in the Brussels area, where I started as a junior programmer and ended my career in information Technology as an IT manager in the same hospital.

In 2008 I moved to Brazil and I decided I wanted to do something completely different in life and follow one of my passions, which was travel. This rebooted my new career as a local guide in Rio de Janeiro and as a trip leader in South America and Western-Europe.</p>
